## About this notebook

This notebook contains code and explanatory text that your should review and run as you read through chapters 13 and 15 of the course textbook, "Data Journalism with R and the Tidyverse". https://thescoop.org/data_journalism_book/
Answer questions and edit the document as directed.

Running this notebook will help you understand key data analysis methods and concepts that you will put into practice during this week's lab. When you come across a new command or verb in R, you should add it to your class reference notebook file along with what it's used for.

When you are finished running the code in this notebook, you will push changes to your course GitHub repo, and upload the link to ELMS as instructed.

You also should update your class reference notebook with code examples and what they mean. When you come across a new concept or R verb, put it in your reference notebook along with a sentence about what it does. For example:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The library function loads an R library such as the tidyverse, providing access to the verbs and functions that library contains. You have to load a library before you can use its functions.

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
```
```{r}
devtools::install_github("r-lib/conflicted")
```

## Instructor in class demonstration outline

-   Load this notebook, and provide overview of R, RStudio (text editor, console, environment window, file explorer), Rmarkdown data notebooks, the reference notebook.
-   Work through the code below, chapter by chapter.
    -   Chapter 13: explain the console and the concept of variables. Explain packages, the Tidyverse, how to install them.
    -   Chapter 15: explain loading libraries, the concept of functions, loading data, the importance of having questions to guide data analysis, and aggregation and summarization.

## Chapter 13

### Task 1: The console

**Task** In the console (look below), type 2+2 and hit enter. What does it return? Type your answer below. 

**Answer:** [1] 4

### Task 2: Variables

**Task** Put the following code -- which stores the numeral 2 as a variable called number -- in the console and hit enter.

```{r}
number <- 2
```

Then type this code to multiply the variable called number by itself.

```{r}
number * number
```

What does it return? Type your answer below:

**Answer:** [1] 4

### Task 3: Install packages

**Task** In the console, run the following code to install the Tidyverse:

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

**Task** Add that

Then run the following code to install the rmarkdown library

```{r}
install.packages('rmarkdown')
```

### Task 4: Load libraries

**Task** Run the following code in the gray-colored codeblock below -- not in the console -- to load the tidyverse library. To run the code, click the little green play button (left facing arrow (shouldn't this be right facing arrow, professor?) ) at the top right of the codeblock. In Rmarkdown data notebooks, we write code inside of codeblocks, and explanatory text in the white area outside of it.

```{r}
# This is a comment inside of a codeblock. Comments doesn't run when we run the codeblock.
# Adding this command is a good way to start your class reference notebook.
library(tidyverse)
```

## Chapter 15

### Task 5: Load data

**Task** Load the UMD courses data by running the following codeblock. The data is contained in an .rds file, which is a binary format for R data.

```{r}
umd_courses <- read_rds("umd_courses.rds")
```

Once it loads, look at the environment window at right in RStudio for umd_courses It's next to a small blue circle with a white arrow in it. To the right of that, look at how many "obs" the dataset has ("obs" is short for observation, which is another way of saying rows or records). Look at how many variables it has (another way of saying columns or fields). Write the number of observations and variables below.

**Answer** There are 79366 observations and 9 variables

### Task 6: Glimpse data

**Task** Run the following codeblock to use glimpse() to get a sense of the data, some of the values in each field/variable/column, and the data types of each field/variable/column.

```{r}
glimpse(umd_courses)
```

In the space below, write the data type for the "id" column and the "seats" column (it's in light gray, offset by \< \>). 

**Answer** data type for "id" is <chr> which stands for character and for "seats" is <dbl> which means it is numerical

### Task 7: Examine data "head"

**Task** Run the following codeblock to use head() to examine the first six rows of data. Explore the data by clicking the black arrow on the right side of the output table, allowing you to examine additional columns.

```{r}
head(umd_courses)
```

#Update:
In the space below, write the name of the entry from the first row of the "title" column. 
 **Answer** "Directed Research"

### Task 8: Explore data with interactive dataframe

**Task** look at the environment window at right in RStudio for umd_courses. It's next to a small blue circle with a white arrow in it. Click on the umd_courses -- not the blue circle. It will open the dataframe as an interactive table. Scroll down to see additional rows. Scroll left (shouldn't this say "right", professor?) to see additional columns. Click on a column name to sort by that column.

#the directions to scroll horizontally seems to be flipped

### Task 9: Group and count

So what if we wanted to know how many classes were offered in each term?

To do that by hand, we'd have to take each of the 79,366 individual rows (or observations or records) and sort them into a pile. We'd put them in groups -- one for each term -- and then count them. To do this, we'll take our dataset and we'll introduce a new operator: `|>`. The best way to read that operator, in my opinion, is to interpret that as "and then do this." The keyboard shortcut for this is cmd-shift-m on the Mac and ctrl-shift-m on Windows. Don't like that character? R now has a new one that does the same thing: `|>`.

#Note to self: use cmd+shift+m to get I> (pipe operator), which means go read the next line and execute it in order

# before going to tools - global operator - code - Use native pipe operator - "%>%"
# after applying "Use native pipe operator" - |> (yay)

**Task** Run the following codeblock:

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(term) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n()
  )
```

Describe what you think each line of this code is doing below, based on the result:

**Answer** It spit out how many classes the university had in each one of those terms, and what I can make of it, the terms are in the format YYYYMM so 201712 is just December 2017.

### Task 10: Adding arrange to sort the data

**Task** Run the following codeblock:

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(term) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(count_classes))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result? 
**Answer** The last line "arrange(desc(count_classes))" which is a code to arrange in descending order does not appear in the previous codeblock but comes in handy if you like to have number of classes each term had arranged in descending order

### Task 11: Grouping by multiple columns

**Task** Run the following codeblock.

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(term, department) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n()
  ) |>
  arrange(term, department)
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, how did the output change and what in the code changed it?

**Answer** Firstly, there is many more rows, 4270 now compared to just 29 in the previous codeblock and 3 columns instead of 2. The variables not only got grouped by term but also by department. To put it simply, The number of classes each of the departments had in each one of terms is displayed as opposed to just the number of classes in each term as in the previous codeblock.

### Task 12: Other summary functions

**Task** Run the following codeblock:

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(term) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n(),
    total_seats = sum(seats)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_seats))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result? 
**Answer** This gives us the total number of classes in each term and how many total seats the university offerred in each of those terms. So first row tells us that August 2024 had 5052 classes with seats totaling to 241341 seats; and this is different from the previous codeblock which gave us the number of classes each of the departments had in each one of terms along with department names. Also since the seats are in descending order we can say that the months of August or January have maximum seats, that is when the Fall and Winter semesters begin. 

### Task 13: different kinds of summarizations

**Task** Run the following codeblock to group the umd_courses dataframe by term. Then do the following summarizations for each term: count the number of courses, add up the total of all seats, and calculate the mean and median contribution number of seats. Then sort so the term with the most total seats is listed first.

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(term) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n(),
    total_seats = sum(seats),
    mean_seats = mean(seats),
    median_seats = median(seats)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_seats))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result? What do the top terms have in common? **Answer** We now have additional columns for mean and median. The order has remained the same since the total seats remain unchanged.

### Task 14: more aggregations

**Task** Run the following codeblock to group the umd_courses dataframe by the department. Then do the following summarizations for each group: count the number of courses, add up the total of all seats, calculate the mean and median number of seats and then add lines to calculate the smallest and largest seat numbers using the `min()` and `max()` functions. Then sort so the department with the largest total number of seats is listed first.

```{r}
umd_courses |>
  group_by(department) |>
  summarise(
    count_classes = n(),
    total_seats = sum(seats),
    mean_seats = mean(seats),
    median_seats = median(seats),
    min_seats = min(seats),
    max_seats = max(seats)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(total_seats))
```

Compared to the previous codeblock, what has changed and how did that affect the result? How is the data sorted?

**Answer** Okay so now, unlike the previous table, we  have grouped departments instead of terms and the max and min seats in each. And the table is sorted by total seats in each of the departments so we have way more rows, 222 as opposed to 29 previously. Also, as expected, the columns have increased by 3 and reduced by 1 to a total of 7 as opposed to 5.

### Task 12: Questions

No code here; I want you to provide three questions that this data suggests to you. What would you like to ask it?

**Answer**

1.  Do students drop classes after the first month of the each session, that is the fall and winter sessions in August and January respectively?

2.  The greater mean than the median for most departments suggests that have a handful of extra large courses with lots of seats that is skewing the mean. There are also courses with zero seats, should those courses be dropped permanently if they have had zero enrollment for say n number of terms?

3.  Why does the university have more seats for Business and Management compared to Communications? Is it because of the demands of the job market or the interest students take in one over the other?
